how to compile the slow project
by cliv3dev (clivefb@hotmail.com)

You need a windows OS,
0. Install ConnectIQ SDK, Java runtime environment, Eclipse IDE
1. edit compile.bat:
update all "D:\sdk\connectIQsdk\" path and change with your actual ConnectIQ sdk path, 
update C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.0_121\bin\java" path and change it to where you installed the Java Runtime
2. open a shell command line (cmd or powershell)
3. goto the directory where you copied the slow project.
4. start connectiq emulator
4. at the root of slow, type:
./compile.bat slow
5. if there are no errors, the batch will start slow.prg in the emulator
or type 'monkeydo ./bin/slow.prg fenix3'

Enjoy !

Most of the code logic is in the source file slowView.mc.
