# almost late! Garmin fēnix 3 Connect IQ watchface

![concept teaser](/doc/tease.jpg) 

 Based on [design concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/33752138/Smart-watch-face-navigating-through-the-day) optimizing watch for daily usabilty. 

 # you rarely need to know exactl hour and minute in the day
 # you need to know what is a current hour quickly (here digital watches are great)
 # and get a sense where you are within the hour (heree analog watches are great)
 # this concept combines the best from bost worlds

 ===============================================

 The watchface laso aims to show sunrise and sunset time, but it is commented because daylight saving time does not work, because Garmin has a bug in [clockTime.dst](https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/System/ClockTime.html#dst-instance_method). It is hardcoded for summer time there now. Whoever know how to fix it, please write me.
