# almost late! Garmin fēnix 3 Connect IQ watchface

![concept teaser](/doc/tease.png) 

* you rarely need to know an exact hour and minute in the day
* you rather need to know what is a current hour quickly (here digital watches are great)
* ...and get a sense of where you are within the hour (here analog watches are great)
* this concept combines the best from both worlds

 Based on a [design concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/33752138/Smart-watch-face-navigating-through-the-day) optimizing watch for daily usabilty. 
 
 If you can contribute to show calendar events in the watchface, that would be awesome! 

 The watchface also aims to show sunrise and sunset time, but it is commented because daylight saving time does not work, because Garmin has a bug in [clockTime.dst](https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/System/ClockTime.html#dst-instance_method). It is hardcoded for summer time there now. Whoever know how to fix it, please write me. 

## Special thanks
* To Diego Fernandez Bravo
* Thank you for sharing your code which was base to this watch face
